Data management is an 80/20 stratified train/validation split using sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split for equal class distribution, then batch loading with DataLoader. To make this reproducible, a RANDOM_SEED is applied to torch, numpy, and random operations. The training process uses nn.CrossEntropyLoss as the criterion and optim.Adam for optimization.",

The model also addresses the complexities in training GANs like issues with convergence, mode collapse (where the generator produces limited variety of outputs), and the difficulty in fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve stable and high-quality image synthesis.",
