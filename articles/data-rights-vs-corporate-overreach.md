# Data Rights vs Corporate Overreach

Your data, your right.

In 2025, your data (your searches, your location, your digital footprint) is as much a part of you as your thoughts or actions. Controlling it should be a fundamental human right, like free speech or personal safety. Yet, privacy policies, those dense documents we all skip, make it hard to understand what’s happening with your data. Written in complex legalese, they obscure how your information is collected and shared, inhibiting the protection and control of your data. It’s time to establish data rights as a foundation of the digital age.

## Privacy Policies

Privacy policies are less a tool for transparency than a calculated veil over corporate avarice. Privacy policies should clarify how your data is handled, but they’re cluttered with vague phrases, making them a maze of jargon. This isn’t an accident. It’s a tactic. Some policies hide practices like apps tracking your location constantly or accessing your microphone for unclear “features.” Most users don’t realize what they’re agreeing to, handing over data without true consent. As we rely on apps for daily life, clear policies would enable us to protect our digital selves.

## Data Rights Are Essential for the 21st Century

Your data isn’t just code; it’s your life: your habits, preferences, and identity. Controlling it is a basic right in an era where apps require your information to function. Yet, the way things are set up often makes it tough to keep your data under control. You’re forced to “agree” to data collection or lose access to services. Laws like the EU’s GDPR give you rights to access or delete your data, but tricky consent forms and vague terms dilute them. A 2023 study found your information is shared with data brokers multiple times a day, fueling an industry worth at least $300 billion.

## Data as a Commodity

Beyond policies, your data is treated as a product. Leaks, like one exposing millions of accounts in 2021, show how vulnerable your information is. From location tracking to behavioral profiling, your digital life is up for grabs. Clear rules and real control could change this.

## It's Your Data

Data rights are human rights. Privacy policies shouldn’t obscure how your information is used. Demand clear language, support stronger laws, and take back control of your digital life. Your data is yours and we should keep it that way.
